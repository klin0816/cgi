# CGI Practice
this is a practice that can let user input student ID and check whether user is in my UIDD_2017's group.

## name.json
use array to make an ID, Name .json file.

## index.html
Use get method to transfer the input tag which id is "ID" to do.njs

## do.njs
get the data from index.html and compare the information from name.json
If the ID is same as any one from the ID array, print out the name.
Else print out "Who are you?"
